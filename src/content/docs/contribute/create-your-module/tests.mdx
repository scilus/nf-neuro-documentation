## Create test cases

The module's test infrastructure is auto-generated when creating a module using
the `nf-core` command. First file you should modify is the `main.nf.test`, which
contains the input and assertion instructions for `nf-test`.

:::note
Multiple tests can be specified one after the other in the `main.nf.test`, 
be sure to corner most of the use-case of your module to ensure catching any 
potential bugs!
:::

### Edit `tests/main.nf.test`

To specify test data, you need to define a `setup` section before the actual
test definition. This setup section will use the `LOAD_TEST_DATA` workflow to
fetch your test data from an available package (refer to [this section]
(/contribute/create-your-module/infrastructure) to learn how to find packages). Once you 
selected the archives and files you need, add a `setup` section before the 
test section.

```groovy
setup {
  run("LOAD_TEST_DATA", alias: "LOAD_DATA") {
    script "../../../../../subworkflows/nf-neuro/load_test_data/main.nf"
    process {
      """
      input[0] = Channel.from( [ "<archive>" ] )
      input[1] = "test.load-test-data"
      """
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the `<archive>` with the name of the one you need and you'll be able to
access the archives within your test suite! Next, you want to define your inputs
for your actual tests. The inputs are defined in a positional order, meaning
that `input[0]` will be the first one provided to your process. Every `input[i]`
represents a channel, so if your process takes, for example, a
`tuple val(meta), path(image)`, you will have to define the meta and image
within the same `input[i]`. A code block for a test that takes this tuple as
input would look like this:

```groovy
    test("example - simple") {
        config "./nextflow.config"
        when {
            process {
                """
                input[0] = LOAD_DATA.out.test_data_directory.map{
                    test_data_directory -> [
                        [ id:'test', single_end:false ], // meta map    -> your meta
                        file("\${test_data_directory}/image.nii.gz") // -> your image file.
                    ]
                }
                """
            }
        }
        then {
            assertAll(
                { assert process.success },
                { assert snapshot(process.out).match() }
            )
        }
    }
```

If your process takes an optional input (such as a mask), you can simply add
an empty list:

```groovy
  """
  input[0] = LOAD_DATA.out.test_data_directory.map{
      test_data_directory -> [
          [ id:'test', single_end:false ], // meta map      -> your meta
          file("\${test_data_directory}/image.nii.gz"), //  -> your image file.
          []                                            //  -> your optional input.
      ]
  }
  """
```

Once you have set up your input correctly, you need to define, in the `then`
section, the assertions to carry on the files and variables the module's
outputs. The `snapshot` function usually takes care of correctly resuming the
data it receives into `md5sums` and most times giving it `process.out` is enough.

```groovy
then {
    assertAll(
        { assert process.success },
        { assert snapshot(process.out).match() }
    )
}
```

However, it is not the case right now for `Nifti` images, which require the use
of a dedicated method to extract a reproducible `md5sum`, aka `Nifti_md5sum`.
To assert a `Nifti` output, in this example case the first one, do the following :

```groovy
then {
    assertAll(
        { assert process.success },
        { assert snapshot(
          Nifti_md5sum(process.out.get(0).get(1)),
          ...
          ).match()
        }
    )
}
```

Here we consider all outputs are `tuples`, with the first field being the
`meta` dictionary associated to it. For more details regarding the possible
assertions, see the [nf-test doc](https://www.nf-test.com/docs/assertions/assertions/).

To add more test cases, you can add multiple `test` sections as defined above
(all within the same `nextflow process {}`). This can be done to test with
different inputs, or different parameters provided through a `nextflow.config`
file. If you want to define specific parameters for a single test, assign the
`nextflow.config` file using the `config` parameter within the test definition
(as shown above). If you want to assign identical parameters for all tests, you
can bind the `nextflow.config` file at the beginning of the `main.nf.test`:

```groovy
nextflow_process {

    name "Test Process <CATEGORY>_<TOOL>"
    script "../main.nf"
    process "<CATEGORY>_<TOOL>"
    config "./nextflow.config"
```

Finally, ensure all the tags at the beginning of the process definition include
the `LOAD_TEST_DATA` subworkflow. If not, add those two lines:

```groovy
    tag "subworkflows"
    tag "subworkflows/load_test_data"
```

Make sure there is no more comments generated by the `nf-core` template, and
you should be good to go!

### Edit `tests/nextflow.config`

The `nextflow.config` file does not exist by default, so you will have to
create it if needed. This is not mandatory, except if you have defined
optional parameters with `task.ext` and want to alter their values for some
test cases. Refer to [this section](/nf-neuro/contribute/create-your-module/arguments) to
see how to scope those parameters to specific tests using `selectors`.

### Generate tests snapshots

:::caution
Verify you are located at the root of `nf-neuro` (not inside modules) before
running commands !
:::

Once you have correctly setup your test cases and made sure the data is available,
the test module has to be pre-tested so output files that gets generated are 
snapshotted correctly before being pushed to `nf-neuro`.

To do so, run:

```bash
nf-core modules test -u <category>/<tool>
```

All the test case you defined will be run, watch out for errors ! Once
everything runs smoothly, look at the snapshot file produced at
`tests/main.nf.test.snap` in your module's directory and validate that ALL
outputs produced by test cases are caught. Their `md5sum` is
critical to ensure future executions of your test produce valid outputs.

### A complete example for the `denoising/nlmeans` module.

Since we used the `denoising/nlmeans` module as an example from the beginning of
this documentation, let's create a test case for this module as a final example.
This example contains only a single test, providing an image and an optional mask
as inputs:

```groovy
nextflow_process {

    name "Test Process DENOISING_NLMEANS"
    script "../main.nf"
    process "DENOISING_NLMEANS"
    config "./nextflow.config"

    tag "modules"
    tag "modules_nfcore"
    tag "denoising"
    tag "denoising/nlmeans"

    tag "subworkflows"
    tag "subworkflows/load_test_data"

    setup {
        run("LOAD_TEST_DATA", alias: "LOAD_DATA") {
            script "../../../../../subworkflows/nf-neuro/load_test_data/main.nf"
            process {
                """
                input[0] = Channel.from( [ "raw_b0.zip", "raw_segmentation.zip" ] )
                input[1] = "test.load-test-data"
                """
            }
        }
    }

    test("denoising - nlmeans") {
        when {
            process {
                """
                ch_split_test_data = LOAD_DATA.out.test_data_directory
                    .branch{
                        b0: it.simpleName == "raw_b0"
                        segmentation: it.simpleName == "raw_segmentation"
                    }
                ch_b0 = ch_split_test_data.b0.map{
                    test_data_directory -> [
                        [ id:'test' ],
                        file("\${test_data_directory}/b0.nii.gz")
                    ]
                }
                ch_mask = ch_split_test_data.segmentation.map{
                    test_data_directory -> [
                        [ id:'test' ],
                        file("\${test_data_directory}/brainmask/slices/axial.nii.gz")
                    ]
                }
                input[0] = ch_b0
                    .join(ch_mask)
                """
            }
        }
        then {
            assertAll(
                { assert process.success },
                { assert snapshot(process.out).match() }
            )
        }
    }
}
```
