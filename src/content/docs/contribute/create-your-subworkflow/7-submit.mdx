## Lint your code

Run linting on your new subworkflow, through the `nf-core` command line :

```bash
nf-core subworkflows lint <subworkflow>
```

and fix all **errors** and as many **warnings** as possible. If at any point you modified files outside of your subworkflow's
directory, those also need to be linted. To do so, run the following commands at the root of the repository :

```bash
prettier --check .
editorconfig-checker
```

You'll get lists of syntax errors to fix from both commands. For prettier, you can run `prettier --write .` to fix most
of them automatically. For `editorconfig-checker`, you'll have to fix them manually.

## Submit your PR

Open a PR to the [nf-neuro repository main branch](https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro/pulls). We'll test everything, make
sure it's working and that code follows standards.

:::note
It's the perfect place to get new tools added to our containers, if need be !

Once **LGTM** has been declared, wave to the maintainers and look at your hard work paying off. **PR merged !**
