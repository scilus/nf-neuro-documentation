### Build efficient neuroimaging pipelines

<b><i style="color:#24b064ff">nf-neuro</i></b> is an open-source initiative originally developed by the [Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab](https://scil.usherbrooke.ca/) (SCIL) 

**Our mission is to provide researchers with scalable, reproducible, and efficient pipelines for neuroimaging applications**.
